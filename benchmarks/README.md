# quant_cast_bench

Memory-bandwidth benchmark for the `quant_cast_gold` recipes. Each recipe is a memory-bound
cast, so the signal is achieved memory bandwidth vs. the B200 ceiling (8 TB/s). Per `mode`, the
benchmark either `torch.compile`s each gold recipe's reference fn (`compile`, the default) or
runs its hand-written kernels (`triton` / `cute`), times each with `do_bench_using_profiling`,
and reports latency + GB/s + % of peak. The `relu (baseline)` row anchors the achievable ceiling
for the shape.

## torchinductor gaps vs triton

* square quant block sizes (32x32, 128x128, etc)
  - For example, on fp8_deepseek_128x128, inductor 44.3% peak mem -> triton 77.1% peak mem
* reductions across M-dim, or K-dim and M-dim in the same kernel
  - For example, on mxfp8_floor_dim_m, inductor 17.5% peak mem -> triton 59.9% peak mem
* fp4
  - nvfp4_swizzle: inductor 23.3% peak mem -> triton 62.6% peak mem

## triton gaps vs SOL (CUDA / CUTLASS / cute)

* reductions across M-dim, or K-dim and M-dim in the same kernel
  - For example, on mxfp8_floor_dim_m, triton 59.9% peak mem -> CUDA 67.7% peak mem

    - The CUDA kernel writes quantized values directly into a transposed smem layout (out_colwise_sh[col][row]) and TMA-stores that smem tile. Triton has no
      user-facing __shared__ + __syncthreads(), so every transpose goes through the compiler's tl.trans — which either (a) produces the uncoalesced 21-sectors/request store, or (b) if you TMA-store it, pays a register→smem
      transpose tax. This is the crux: CUDA decouples "coalesced transposed store" from "small register footprint," and Triton cannot.
    - Efficient TMA transfers and high occupancy at the same time. CUDA gets both because it manages smem by hand and uses tiny 64-thread CTAs. In Triton, TMA transfer size and occupancy are both governed by the tile size, so
      you're forced to choose — big tiles (efficient TMA, low occupancy) or small tiles (high occupancy, tiny inefficient TMA transfers).

## Repro

```bash
cd /home/dev/quant_cast_bench

# torch.compile the gold reference fns (default mode)
python benchmarks/benchmark.py --mode compile

# hand-written Triton kernels
python benchmarks/benchmark.py --mode triton

# optional: single shape / single recipe
python benchmarks/benchmark.py --mode triton --M 16384 --K 16384
python benchmarks/benchmark.py --mode triton --recipe_name_filter mxfp8_floor_dim_m
```

Default shape is `(M, K) = (16384, 16384)`. Assumes a B200 (peak 8 TB/s).

## Output

![Memory bandwidth by mode](mem_bw.png)

*Achieved memory bandwidth (% of the B200 8 TB/s peak) per kernel, one bar per implementation
(`compile` / `triton` / `cute`); the dashed line is the eager-`relu` bandwidth ceiling. The
compile-only kernels (`bf16_rht`, `fp32_to_bf16_sr`, ...) have no triton/cute bar. Data lives in
[`bench_results.csv`](bench_results.csv); regenerate the chart with `python benchmarks/plot_bench.py`.
Refresh the data by re-running the sweeps with the
`--csv` flag — `rm benchmarks/bench_results.csv` then
`benchmark.py --mode {compile,triton,cute} --csv benchmarks/bench_results.csv` (once per mode). A
fresh sweep can differ ±1–2 pts from the tables below (run-to-run variance).*

### `--mode cute`

The CuTeDSL (`cutlass.cute`) kernels are **correctness-first (naive tiling), with twelve tuned
exceptions** — treat the untuned rows as a functional baseline, not a fair comparison to the
compile/triton numbers above:

* `fp8_tensorwise_precalc_scale` (85.8%) — vectorized 128-bit copy atoms (`num_bits_per_copy` +
  `assumed_align=16`) hit DRAM speed-of-light.
* `mxfp8_floor_swizzle` (67.6%) — same vectorized-copy recipe as tensorwise: flatten to 1-D, 128
  threads/CTA, each thread owns one contiguous 1×32 block, 128-bit vectorized load/store. The
  e8m0 scale is scattered to the swizzled 4D grid. ncu shows the ~68% ceiling is structural: the
  per-block reduction forces the full 32-wide f32 vector live (48 reg/thread → 48% occupancy, vs
  the 29 reg / 80% occ of the pure-elementwise tensorwise), and the scattered scale-byte write
  costs ~5 pts (a 1-D CTA covers part of one row, so the swizzled positions don't coalesce). A
  paired-lane VPT=16 variant restored occupancy (32 reg / 83%) but was *slower* (61.6%) — reducing
  from a smaller register fragment loses memory-level parallelism. Reaching the triton 81.5% would
  need a TMA + 128×128 swizzle-atom kernel (reduce from smem to avoid the register spike; write the
  512 scale bytes contiguously) — future work.
* `fp8_deepseek_1x128` (73.6%) — the same vectorized-copy recipe applied to 1×128 blocks: flatten
  to 1-D, 128 threads/CTA, VPT=32 with 128-bit vectorized load/store. A 1×128 block spans 4
  contiguous threads (4×32=128), so the per-thread abs-max is combined across the group with
  `warp_reduction_max(threads_in_group=4)` and the group leader scatters the fp32 scale. It edges
  out `mxfp8_floor_swizzle` (67.6%) despite the same 48-reg reduction profile because the fp32 scale
  write happens once per 128 elements (vs once per 32 for swizzle) — 4× fewer scattered stores.
* `mxfp8_floor_dim_m` (60.3%) — warp-specialized **TMA**: TMA-load a (64,256) tile, reduce 32-row
  blocks per column to the e8m0-floor scale, quantize, transpose in the register→smem write, and
  TMA-store the (256,64) tile to the row-major (N,M) output. Beats the triton kernel (60.1%) and
  approaches the CUDA SOL (67.7%). See [`quant_cast_cute/recipes.py`](../quant_cast_bench/quant_cast_cute/recipes.py).
* `fp8_deepseek_1x128_dim_m` (61.7%) — the same TMA path as `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`, with a 128-row
  block (not 32) and an fp32 `amax/448` scale (not an e8m0 byte). TMA-load a (128,128) tile, each
  thread scans its 128-row column for the amax in four 32-wide chunks (vector reduce, only 32 f32
  live → low registers), then re-reads to quantize and write the transposed contiguous run into
  sOUT for the TMA store. Tile is (128,128)/4 warps: a (128,256) tile needs 96 KB smem → only 2
  CTAs/SM, which halved bandwidth (38.7%); dropping to (128,128) restores 48 KB/4 CTAs → 61.7%,
  matching `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`'s footprint. Beats the triton dim-M kernel and approaches its
  compile-mode SOL. (Replaces the old scalar `x.t()` path at ~7%.)
* `fp8_deepseek_1x128_dim_km` (41.2%) — the one-pass both-directions deepseek cast (dim-K `qk (M,N)`
  + `sk (M,N//128)`; dim-M `qm (N,M)` + `sm (N,M//128)`, transposed), the fp32-scale/128-block analog
  of `mxfp8_floor_dim_km`. Same fused TMA template: TMA-load one (128,128) tile, reduce both ways —
  dim-M writes the transposed run into sOUT for a TMA store; dim-K keeps `x`'s layout so it quantizes
  in-register and stores each 32-chunk **directly to gmem** with a 128-bit copy. Beats compile
  (35.8%) but sits **below the 1×32 sibling (57.4%) and triton (57.8%)**, for two reasons ncu makes
  clear (both intrinsic to the 128-block): (1) the dim-K row reads are **32-way** bank-conflicted (vs
  16-way at 1×32) — a 128-col bf16 block is bank-aligned, so a thread-per-block read has every lane on
  the same bank regardless of tile/mapping; (2) doing both 128-reductions per thread needs 154
  reg/thread → 3 CTAs/SM. Occupancy is *not* the lever, though (L1/TEX ~86%): warp-splitting the two
  directions (one dir/thread, ~72 reg, 2× occupancy) made it **worse** (35%), as did non-unrolled
  chunk loops (30%) — both cost ILP. The real fix for the conflict is a **swizzled sIN smem layout**
  (as for the 1×32 sibling), left as future work.
* `fp8_deepseek_128x128` (70.1%) — non-transposing **TMA** with a block-wide reduction (one fp32
  scale per whole 128×128 block). One CTA/block: TMA-load the (128,128) tile to smem, each thread
  reduces its share to a local amax, then a warp-reduce + smem block-reduce gives the block amax;
  re-read, quantize, TMA-store the (128,128) tile (no transpose). The **crux is the smem access
  pattern**: giving each thread a *contiguous* run puts all 32 warp lanes on one bank (32-way
  conflict → 4.3%, worse than the old kernel); switching to a *strided* assignment (thread `t` owns
  `{t + i·THREADS}`) so consecutive lanes hit consecutive banks lifts it to 70.1%. 128 threads/CTA
  beat 256/512 (higher VPT → more memory-level parallelism per thread).
* `mxfp8_32x32_floor` (70.8%) — one e8m0-floor scale per 32×32 block; non-transposing, so the same
  TMA path as `fp8_deepseek_128x128`. A 32×32 block = 1024 elems = a full warp (32 lanes × 32 rows),
  so **one warp owns one block** and the block amax is a single `warp_reduction_max` — no cross-warp
  scratch. A 128×128 TMA tile holds 16 blocks; 8 warps each loop over 2 of them (lane `l` owns
  column `l` → consecutive lanes hit consecutive smem banks). Two findings each moved it ~38%→70%:
  (1) `v / sfp` on the 32-wide vector emits 32 per-element **divisions** (168M insts, 38%) — since
  the e8m0 scale is a power of two, `inv = 1/sfp; v * inv` is bit-exact and cuts to 95M insts (matches
  deepseek); (2) using 8 warps/CTA (not 4) doubles resident warps at the same smem-capped 4 CTAs/SM,
  hiding the TMA-load latency the kernel is bound on. A direct coalesced fp8 *global* store (drop the
  sOUT smem to raise occupancy) was tried but is worse (50.5%) — the whole-tile TMA store beats
  scattered 32-byte fp8 sectors. Matches the deepseek_128x128 sibling's ~70% ceiling (triton 76.5%).
* `fp8_rowwise` (79.7%) — one fp32 scale per row, amax over the whole row. The naive kernel held the
  whole row live (one 512-thread CTA/row), which pinned it at 58 reg/thread → 43% occupancy → 60%
  DRAM (3.0% of peak here since it was also unvectorized). The fix mirrors triton/inductor: a small
  256-thread CTA per row that **loops over the row in BN=4096 blocks** (VPT=16, 128-bit vectorized
  ld/st) accumulating a per-thread abs-max (only 16 elems live/iter), warp+smem block-reduce for the
  row amax, then a second loop re-reads each block — warm in L2 from pass 1, like triton's
  `evict_last`/`evict_first` hints — to quantize and store. Registers drop to 32, occupancy to 90%,
  DRAM to 82.6%. Beats triton (76.7%) and matches compile (79.0%); the extra L2 read pass costs
  little at this occupancy. (Replaces the old one-warp-per-row scalar kernel at 3.0%.)
* `fp8_colwise` (46.0%) — one fp32 scale per column, amax over all rows, transposed (N,M) output.
  The reduction is *down* a column (the strided axis of row-major x), so a naive kernel is forced
  into uncoalesced reads (1.6%). Mirror triton's two coalesced passes but drive both with **TMA**:
  pass 1 TMA-loads (128,256) tiles, each thread reduces its column's rows in smem to a partial amax,
  then `atomic_max_float32` into a (N,) scratch (combining across the M-grid); pass 2 TMA-loads
  (64,256) tiles, quantizes each column with the precomputed `amax/448` scale, transposes in the
  register→smem write (like `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`), and TMA-stores the (256,64) tile. The TMA engine
  streams the strided tiles at DRAM speed — a hand-rolled strided row-segment read of x caps the amax
  pass at ~42% (152 µs) vs TMA's ~67% (93 µs). Beats triton (43.8%) and compile (25.6%). The ~51%
  ceiling is structural: a full-column amax forces reading x *twice* and, unlike rowwise, the quant
  re-read misses L2 (a full column is 32 KB·M, far larger than L2; the whole 512 MB streams between
  the two kernels). L2-panel tiling doesn't help — separate TMA kernels don't retain the panel, and
  per-CTA reuse needs <6 concurrent CTAs. (Replaces the old scalar `x.t()` path at 1.6%.)

* `nvfp4_swizzle` (~62%) — the two-level nvfp4 cast (per-tensor outer scale × per-16-block e4m3
  inner scale, fp4-packed qdata, e4m3 scale scattered to the swizzled 4D grid), modeled on the
  human-optimized torchao fp4 CuTeDSL cast (pytorch/ao#4517). The unit of work is a "group" of 32
  elems = two 1×16 blocks = one 128-bit fp4 store. The old naive kernel (8 thr/CTA, scalar
  per-element loads) was 7.9%. ncu shows it's **ALU-pipe bound** (~73%), not DRAM bound, and three
  fixes lifted it: (1) hardware inline-PTX cvts — `cvt.rn.satfinite.e2m1x2.f32` packs 8 f32 → 4 fp4
  bytes/call (one `mov.b32`, no per-byte masking) and `cvt e4m3x2` / `f16x2.e4m3x2` do the two-level
  scale as single instructions, vs the 4-lane-broadcast e4m3 fragments + `_maybe_recast_from_f4`;
  (2) hoisting the swizzle offset — the 4D flatten factors as `row_base + (col//4)*512 + (col%4)`
  (the per-row div/mod chain was the dominant ALU term); (3) a **warp-per-row** mapping (ao#4517's
  "wpr") — warp `w` owns row `bidy*WARPS+w`; its 32 lanes + a `grid.x` column split + ILP stripe
  that row's groups, all loads issued first for MLP. Because the row is fixed per warp, `row_base`
  is computed *once* and amortized over every group the lane visits (vs 2 in a 1-D-flatten mapping),
  and a whole row's scale bytes land in one 128-row swizzle atom. This beat a 1-D striped mapping
  (~58%, long-scoreboard-bound at 44% occ). Tuned WARPS=2, XSPLIT=4, ILP=4. Beats compile (23.5%)
  and edges the repo's triton (62.7%) at peak; the identical ao#4517 kernel on this same swizzle
  layout measures 58.5% (its striped mapping) / 63.1% (its wpr) here. (The swizzle scale-scatter is
  the ceiling: the *linear* scale layout hits ~70% on the same kernel, but our recipe needs the
  blocked swizzle.) (`nvfp4_blocked_outer` keeps the naive kernel — it wasn't the target.)

* `mxfp8_floor_dim_km` (57.4%) — the one-pass both-directions mxfp8-floor cast: read `x` once and
  emit four outputs, dim-K (`qk (M,N)` + `sk (M,N//32)`, 1×32 blocks along columns) and dim-M
  (`qm (N,M)` + `sm (N,M//32)`, 32×1 blocks down rows, transposed). The **fused TMA BM×BN template**
  (mirrors `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`): TMA-load one (64,256) row-major tile into smem, read it once and
  reduce BOTH ways, then emit the two quantized tiles. dim-M (the binding half): each of the
  TM·TN/32 (col, 32-row-block) groups reads its 32 rows *down* a column, e8m0-scales, quantizes, and
  writes the run into an sOUT laid out (TN,TM) — the transpose is the register→smem write — for a TMA
  store to the `(N,M)` output. dim-K rides the loaded tile nearly for free: each (row, 32-col-block)
  group reads its 32 *along* a row, and since `qk` keeps `x`'s layout it quantizes in-register and
  stores the contiguous 32-run **directly to gmem with a 128-bit vectorized copy** (adjacent threads
  = adjacent col-blocks → coalesced). Went **18.9% → 57.4%** (naive 32×32/1-warp kernel → this),
  beating triton (47.1%) and nearing the standalone `mxfp8_floor_dim_m` (60.3%). Keeping `qk` out of
  smem was worth +5 pts alone (52% → 57%): it frees 16 KB → +1 CTA/SM (occupancy 37.5% → 50%) and
  drops the dim-K transpose-store bank conflicts. **The remaining ceiling is L1/TEX (ncu ~82%)**: the
  dim-K row reads are ≥16-way bank-conflicted because a 32-col bf16 block is exactly 16 banks wide,
  so thread-per-block reads collapse to 2 bank groups regardless of tile/mapping (bank depends only
  on column when TN is a multiple of 64). Killing that needs a **swizzled smem layout** for the input
  tile (XOR swizzle, as CUTLASS GEMM uses) that *also* keeps the dim-M column reads conflict-free —
  the real next step, left as future work.

## Known issues

* `fp32_to_bf16_sr` (compile) reports only ~19.6% peak, but this understates the real bandwidth.
  The stochastic-rounding uniform is drawn via `torch.func._random.uniform` → `aten._philox_uniform`,
  which inductor treats as an opaque extern op rather than a fusible in-kernel RNG. So it runs as
  two DRAM passes: kernel 1 materializes a full-size fp32 random tensor (~1.07 GB write, ~63% of
  the runtime), kernel 2 reads it back alongside `x` to dither+truncate. Real traffic is ~3.76 GB
  (write u + read x + read u + write out) ≈ 46% of peak; the benchmark only counts input+output
  (~1.61 GB), so the wasted RNG round-trip shows up as the low 19.6%. Fix: fuse the Philox RNG into
  the dither kernel (generate uniforms in-register, never materialize) — as inductor already does
  for `torch.rand`/dropout — which would cut traffic to ~1.61 GB and approach the relu ceiling
  (~2–3× speedup).

* `bf16_rht` (compile) runs at only ~29% peak, and here the traffic is not wasted (the whole 1.07 GB
  is useful read x + write out) — it's GEMM-kernel inefficiency. The 16×16 RHT `x.reshape(..., 16) @ rht`
  is lowered to a single cuBLAS GEMM via `extern_kernels.mm`, shape `(M·N/16, 16) @ (16, 16)` — i.e.
  `K=16, N=16`. That GEMM is ~99.5% of the runtime. The op is really memory-bound (~4 flop/byte), but
  cuBLAS runs it as a compute-oriented matmul, and the skinny `K=N=16` shape tiles terribly (N-tiling
  wasted, no K-reuse to amortize), so it fails to saturate DRAM — 29% vs the ~75% relu ceiling for the
  same 1.07 GB (~2.6× slower than bandwidth-bound). Fix direction: a fused kernel that loads a 16-vector,
  applies the transform in registers, and writes 16 (or a Triton matmul template tuned for the skinny
  shape) would approach the relu ceiling.

* `nvfp4_swizzle` (compile) runs at only ~23% peak (vs the Triton kernel's 62.6%), because inductor
  splits it into **3 separate kernels** instead of one fused pass:
  1. per-16-block `amax` reduction (reads `x` → block amaxes),
  2. quantize: reads **`x` again** + outer scale + amaxes, computes the inner e4m3 scale and the fp4
     data, writes packed nvfp4 (this kernel does contain the hardware `cvt.rn.satfinite.e2m1x2.f32`
     fp4 encode — see `_f32_to_packed_fp4`),
  3. a `permute/transpose` scatter that writes the swizzled inner scale.
  So `x` is streamed **twice** (the quantize can't fuse with the reduction it depends on) and the
  swizzle is a separate scatter. The hand-written Triton kernel collapses all of this into **one**
  pass — load each block once, reduce to amax in-register, quantize from those registers, and write
  both the fp4 data and the swizzled scale — which is the bulk of the 62.6% vs 23% gap. Note the fp4
  encode itself is *not* the bottleneck (~60% in isolation); adding the hardware `cvt` (gated to
  compile via `inline_asm_elementwise`, like torchao's `_to_mx_rceil`) only moved it 20.7% → 23%.
  Fix direction: a single fused reduce+quantize+swizzle kernel (what Triton/CUDA do), which inductor
  won't generate here.

* `fp8_deepseek_1x128_dim_km` (compile) runs at only ~35.8% peak. The gold recipe expresses a
  **single pass** that reads `x` once and reduces it both ways (dim-K = 1×128 along columns, dim-M =
  128×1 along rows) to emit all four outputs — but inductor generates **3 kernels that each read `x`
  (x streamed 3×)**:
  1. dim-K, fully fused — a persistent reduction that reads `x`, computes the per-128 amax + scale,
     and quantizes in one kernel → `qdata_k` + `scale_k`;
  2. dim-M `amax` reduction — reads `x` again, reduces over the 128 rows → `scale_m`;
  3. dim-M quantize + transpose — reads `x` a **third** time + the dim-M scale → `qdata_m` (transposed).
  Two structural reasons: dim-K and dim-M are treated as independent subgraphs so they don't share
  the load of `x`, and dim-M splits reduce-from-normalize (the quantize depends on the reduction, same
  pattern as `nvfp4_swizzle`). So the ~35.8% is roughly the cost of ~3 passes over `x` plus the
  transposed dim-M store, not the intended single pass. All 3 are Triton (no cuBLAS/extern).
  **The hand-written Triton kernel realizes the single pass (57.8%, ~1.6× the compile 35.8%)**: one
  128×128 tile of `x` is loaded once, reduced both ways in-register (128 columns for dim-K, 128 rows
  for dim-M), and all four outputs are written (dim-M transposed). It lands near the standalone
  `fp8_deepseek_1x128_dim_m` (~68%) rather than the standalone dim-K (~76%), because the transposed
  dim-M store is the binding cost — dim-K rides the already-loaded tile essentially for free.

* `mxfp8_floor_dim_km` (compile ~19.1%, triton ~47.1%) — the mxfp8-floor analog of the above (1×32
  dim-K + 32×1 dim-M, e8m0 scales). Same story under compile: inductor generates **3 kernels reading
  `x` 3×** (dim-K fused reduce+quantize; dim-M amax reduction; dim-M quantize+transpose). The
  hand-written Triton kernel does the single pass. A first fixed **32×32 tile** version only reached
  ~30.9% (the transposed dim-M store is only 32-wide, poorly coalesced, and each program does little
  work); switching to **blocked tiles** (autotuned `RB` 32-row blocks × `BN` cols, reshape per
  direction — the same lever that fixed `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`) widens the dim-M store and raises
  occupancy, reaching **47.1%**. Still below deepseek's dim_km (57.8%) because the 32-block
  granularity means 4× as many e8m0 scales (M/32 vs M/128) plus the per-scale e8m0 bit-math, and the
  transposed dim-M store remains the binding cost.

* `fp32_to_bf16_sr_global_offsets` (compile) runs at only ~6.2% peak — ~3.2× slower than
  `fp32_to_bf16_sr` (19.6%) for identical dithering math. The difference is how the Philox draw is
  keyed. Both use `torch.func._random.uniform` (experimental stateless Philox → unfused
  `aten._philox_uniform`, so both share the same materialized-`u` ~46%-real-BW ceiling). The plain
  variant keys on tile-LOCAL position (one shared key, counter = flat index within the call), which
  is cheap but changes with tiling. The global variant is tile-INVARIANT: it keys each draw on the
  element's GLOBAL index, which — because `uniform` only exposes a single scalar starting offset (the
  `(seed, offset)` key pair, fine for 1D/full-width tiles but not 2D sub-blocks) — forces
  materializing a per-element `(numel, 2)` uint64 key tensor = **4.29 GB** (16 B/element, 8× the
  0.54 GB bf16 output), written then read back by a batched Philox. That ~8.5 GB key round-trip
  triples total traffic (~12.3 GB vs ~3.76 GB), matching the 3.2× slowdown.

### Fix direction: key by global index without materializing keys

The global index only needs to reach Philox as a *counter*. Today the sole knob is the key's single
scalar `offset` — one value per call, which can only shift a 1-D contiguous stream, so it cannot
express a 2-D sub-block's global index and the recipe is forced to fold the index into a
**per-element key tensor** (`(numel, 2)` uint64, 4.29 GB). If `uniform` instead accepted a per-element
**affine counter** (a `base` plus per-dim `strides`), element `(i, j)` could take
`counter = base + i·num_col + j` computed *in-kernel from its own indices* — one shared key, zero
materialized index/key tensors. Combined with a fusible in-kernel Philox (as Triton's
`tl.rand(seed, offset)` already allows), the whole tile-invariant SR becomes one fused kernel that
never materializes `u` either — approaching the relu ceiling.

## Why `mxfp8_floor_dim_m` (59.9%) is slower than `fp8_deepseek_1x128_dim_m` (71.2%)

Both are the same shape of kernel — load a bf16 tile, reduce down M per column, scale, `.to(fp8)`,
transposed store — and both are memory-bound. The gap is entirely about **register pressure**, which
decides whether you can afford a *tall* tile (good transposed-store coalescing) at high occupancy.

* **deepseek is light:** one `amax` over the whole 128-row block → one fp32 scale/column, `x/scale`.
  At a **128-row tile** it uses ~72 reg/thread → 40% occupancy **and** 128-wide coalesced stores
  (~17.8 sectors/req) → **68.6% DRAM**. It gets both at once.
* **mxfp8 is heavier:** it reshapes `(RB·32, BN) → (RB, 32, BN)`, reduces per **32-row sub-block**
  (4 scales/column at RB=4, vs deepseek's 1), and quantizes to e8m0. At the same 128-row tile that
  needs ~121–127 reg/thread → only ~23% occupancy → ~40–44% DRAM. So the autotuner is forced to a
  **32-row tile**, which restores occupancy (~40%) but narrows the transposed store to 32-wide
  (~21.3 sectors/req) → **~60% DRAM**. mxfp8 is stuck in an occupancy-vs-coalescing bind that
  deepseek's lighter math avoids.

ncu at a matched 128-row tile (`RB=4, BN=64`):

| | reg/thread | occupancy | store sectors/req | DRAM % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| deepseek (its real tile) | 72 | 40.5% | 17.8 | 68.6% |
| mxfp8 (forced small tile) | 69 | 40.5% | 21.3 | 57–60% |
| mxfp8 at deepseek's tile | 121–127 | 23.3% | 16.0 | 39–44% |

The register cost is **structural, not the e8m0 math**: replacing the manual e8m0-floor bit
extraction with the hardware `cvt.rz.satfinite.ue8m0x2.f32` instruction (see the mxfp8 kernel) only
freed ~6 registers (127→121) and moved the number 57.9% → 59.9% — the bulk of the pressure is the
fp32 working tile plus the `(RB,32,BN)` reshape and `tl.trans` transpose staging, plus holding 4×
the per-column scale state. Closing the gap to deepseek would require cutting *that* (e.g. a
shared-memory transpose to decouple store coalescing from tile height), not cheaper scale math.

## cuteDSL notes

### Optimizing `mxfp8_floor_swizzle` further (67.6% → target ~triton 81.5%)

The current cute kernel uses the tensorwise vectorized-copy recipe (1-D flatten, 128 thr/CTA, each
thread owns one contiguous 1×32 block, 128-bit ld/st). ncu shows the ~68% ceiling is structural, and
splits into two independent costs — an **occupancy** cost (~12 pts) and a **scatter** cost (~5 pts):

| variant | reg/thread | occupancy | DRAM % | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| elementwise ceiling (no reduce/scatter) | 29 | 80% | 85.7% | same as tensorwise |
| VPT=32, one block/thread (shipped) | 48 | 48.7% | 73.5% | reduction forces 32-wide f32 live |
| VPT=32, contiguous scale store | 47 | 47.4% | 78.1% | isolates the scatter cost (~5 pts) |
| VPT=16 paired lanes (2 lanes/block) | 32 | 83.4% | 64.1% | higher occ, **lower** BW — rejected |

Two dead ends already ruled out (don't repeat):

* **Reduce in bf16** to shrink the live vector — the compiler CSEs the store's f32 back, regs stay 48.
* **Paired-lane VPT=16** (two lanes share the block amax via `warp_reduction_max(threads_in_group=2)`)
  — cuts regs to 32 and lifts occupancy to 83%, but DRAM *drops* to 64%: reducing from a smaller
  register fragment loses memory-level parallelism. For a reduction kernel, **bigger VPT wins** even
  at lower occupancy.

Suggested next step — a **TMA + 128×128 swizzle-atom kernel** (mirrors `mxfp8_floor_dim_m`, minus the
transpose since qdata here is *not* transposed). This attacks both costs at once:

1. **CTA = one swizzle atom** = 128 rows × 4 col-blocks (128×128 = 512 mxfp8 blocks). The atom's 512
   e8m0 bytes are **contiguous** in the `(nrb, ncb, 32, 16)` grid at offset `(br*ncb+bc)*512`, so the
   scale write becomes one coalesced store instead of a byte scatter → recovers the ~5 pts. (This is
   exactly how the nvfp4 triton kernel lays out its scale store — see `_nvfp4_swizzle_kernel`.)
2. **TMA-load the (128,128) bf16 tile into smem**, then do the per-block abs-max **reductions from
   smem**, not from a register fragment. This is the key occupancy fix: the 32 values a block reduces
   live in smem, so no thread holds a 32-wide f32 vector → registers stay near the 29-reg elementwise
   profile → occupancy back to ~80% (recovers the ~12 pts). Quantize, write fp8 to an smem out-tile,
   TMA-store row-major→row-major (no transpose gotcha, unlike dim_m).
3. Reuse the multi-warp TMA barrier pattern and `_e8m0_floor` helper already in `recipes.py`; the
   `mxfp8_floor_dim_m` kernel is the working template for the TMA load/store + barrier plumbing.

Expected: ~80%+ (elementwise ceiling 85.7% minus a small reduction/coalescing tax), matching triton.
The trade-off is complexity — it's roughly the effort of the dim_m TMA kernel, which is why the
simpler 67.6% vectorized-copy version was shipped first.
